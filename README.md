# CSCI625
## Instructions
There are 5 notebooks in this project, 2 data processing scripts and the rest are machine learning scripts. 
All the processed data files are also available at the below link, so it is not necessary to run the data processing scripts because it would take a while to run. More details about the data please refer to the data section in this paper.
In the anomaly.ipynb and positive.ipynb files there are a few blocks with grid search hyperparameter tunning, if you wish to run the script, I suggest comment out the grid search for one class SVM, or remove RBF kernel from the parameter set, including those would increase the running time by hours.
